# What is this?

This is a Javascript book editor that saves to GitHub.
Since it is just javascript, it can be hosted on github.com by using the `gh-pages` branch.

Editing various mime-types is supported by writing plugins (ie SVG, Markdown, etc).

**Developers**: If you're looking to contribute, check out the [TODO](#todo) section at the bottom of this file!


# How does it work?

Unzip an EPUB3 document and push it to GitHub.

This editor uses the GitHub API to read/write EPUB3 files (defined in http://idpf.org/epub/30/spec/epub30-overview.html ).


# Development and Building

Below are instructions for building the book editor yourself and a layout
of how the code is organized.

## Building Yourself

1. Create a local branch named `gh-pages`
2. Run `npm install .` to download the dependencies
3. Build a minified Javascript file by running `r.js` (see https://github.com/jrburke/r.js)
4. Add the minified Javscript file, commit, and push the changes back to github

## Building Documentation

Documentation is built using `docco`.

    find . -name "*.coffee" | grep -v './lib/' | grep -v './node_modules' | xargs ./node_modules/docco/bin/docco

Check the `./docs` directory to read through the different modules.

## Directory Layout

* `bookish/*`   Base models and views for editing books (TOC navigation, HTML content, media resources)
* `epub/*`  Models specific to manipulating EPUB3 books (ie a book is an OPF file plus a separate navigation HTML file)
* `gh-book/*` GitHub-specific views and `Backbone.sync` calls that communicate to read/write files to GitHub

* `bookish/models.coffee`    Backbone Models
* `bookish/views.coffee`     Marionette Views
* `bookish/views/*`          Handlebars Templates
* `bookish/nls/*.coffee`     i18n strings (and HTML) http://requirejs.org/docs/api.html#i18n
* `lib/`                 3rd party libraries
* `config/*`             Custom configuration of 3rd party libraries (Aloha Editor and MathJax)
* `config/bookish-config.coffee` Includes paths to 3rd party libs so we can minify them

* `gh-book.coffee`   The starting point for all javascript

## Adding a 3rd party library

1. If a npm version of it exists, add it to `package.json`
2. Otherwise, add it to `install-libs.sh` (which is called when you run `npm install .`)
3. Add the lib to `config/bookish-config.coffee` (both in `path` and `shim`)
    * The name should be all lowercase
    * Use a `-` if the library name is more than one word
    * Don't use `/` or `.`

4. Use it in your module by adding it to the dependencies in `define`

# TODO

There is still a lot of work that needs to be done before this editor is adoptable.
Here are some things on my roadmap.

If you're looking to contribute, tackling one of these would be a great place to start!

* `[ ]` Add Markdown plugin that edits Markdown and autogenerates HTML (search for `MIME_TYPES` in the code)
* `[X]` Save images as resources instead of embedded data URIs (plug into Aloha Upload/Repository API)
* `[X]` Update the OPF file with added resources
* `[ ]` Add UI for intra-book links (needs to be separate Aloha plugin)
* `[ ]` Add "cleanup" button that deletes content/resources that are no longer referred to
* `[X]` Save `<html><head/><body/></html>` wrapper around HTML content instead of just saving `<div/>` tags
* `[ ]` Generate `toc.ncx` file for EPUB2 compatibility
* `[X]` Get 'Add Content' working again (when should the id be assigned and the content saved?)

* `[X]` Notify user when github karma (requests/hour) runs out so they know to sign in
* `[X]` Only enable Save button when content has changed
* `[X]` Show user unsaved files
* `[X]` Only show 'Copy this book!' when the current user is different than the repo user
